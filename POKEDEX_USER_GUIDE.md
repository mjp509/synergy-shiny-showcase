## Pokédex Page Guide

### Overview

The Pokédex page is your comprehensive hub for exploring, searching, and filtering Pokémon. Whether you're tracking shinies, looking for specific Pokémon in locations, or filtering by type and abilities, all tools are available on one page.

### Main Display Areas

#### 1. **Mode Selector** (Top Left)
Choose between two tracking modes:

**Shiny Mode** (Default)
- Shows Pokémon marked as caught in shiny form
- Displays which team members have caught each shiny
- Shows "Complete" checkmark when all team members have it
- Best for: Tracking team collection progress through evolution lines

**Living Dex Mode**
- Shows Pokémon caught in regular (non-shiny) form
- Best for: Tracking team complete collection progress, excluding evolution lines.
- 
To switch modes, click the toggle between "Shiny" and "Living Dex" buttons.

#### 2. **Search Bar** (Top Center)
Instantly search for Pokémon by name.

**How to Use:**
- Type any Pokémon name (case-insensitive)
- Results filter in real-time as you type
- Examples: "pikachu", "CHARMANDER", "bulbA"
- Partial matches work too: "chu" finds "pikachu"

**Search Tips:**
- Search clears when you select a new filter

#### 3. **Filter Panels** (Left Sidebar)

All filter panels work together - select multiple options across different panels to narrow results. You can combine all filters below:

##### **Encounter Type Filter**
Filter Pokémon by how common they are to find:
- **All Encounter Types** - Show everything (default)
- **Very Common** - Easily found Pokemon (appears frequently)
- **Common** - Standard encounters
- **Uncommon** - Less frequent encounters
- **Rare** - Difficult to find
- **Very Rare** - Extremely rare encounters
- **Fishing** - Only found by fishing
- **Horde** - Only found in hordes
- **Lure** - Only from lure encounters

**Example:** Select "Horde" to see only horde huntable Pokémon

##### **Tier (Rarity) Filter**
Filter by overall rarity tier:
- **Tier 0** - Very Common (Pidgey, Rattata, etc.)
- **Tier 1-3** - Common to Uncommon
- **Tier 4-5** - Rare
- **Tier 6** - Very Rare
- **Tier 7** - Legendary/Mythical (Mewtwo, Mew, Arceus, etc.)

**Use Case:** Want to hunt only for rare Pokémon? Select Tier 2-0


##### **Egg Group Filter**
Filter by breeding group:
- **Dragon** - Dragon Egg-Group Pokemon
- **Mineral** - Rock Egg-Group Pokemon
- **Flying** - Flying Egg-Group Pokemon
- ... etc

**Use Case:** "I need to breed Dragon-types" → Select Dragon egg group

##### **Type Filter**
Filter by Pokémon type(s):
- Select one or more types (Fire, Water, Electric, etc.)
- Pokémon matching ALL selected types will be shown
- **Example:** Select "Water" + "Flying" = shows only Water/Flying types like Pelipper

**Note:** Selecting multiple types uses AND logic (not OR)

##### **Move Filter**
Search for Pokémon by move name:
- Type move name in search box
- Example: "Eruption", "Surf", "Grass Knot"
- Searches Up to 4 Moves

**Tip:** If you don't remember exact name, partial match works

##### **Ability Filter**
Search for Pokémon by ability name:
- Type ability name in search box
- Example: "Swift Swim", "Intimidate", "Lightning Rod"
- Searches both regular and hidden abilities

**Tip:** If you don't remember exact name, partial match works

##### **Location Filter**
Filter Pokémon by where they're found:
- Type location name: "ROUTE 3 - Kanto", "FOREST - Johto"
- Format: **LOCATION - REGION**
- Must include both location and region for results

**Example Uses:**
- "ROUTE 3 - KANTO" shows all Pokémon on Route 3 in Kanto
- "FOREST" alone won't work - need region too
- Use AutoComplete in the input to quickly select desired routes

**How it auto-populates:** When you click a location card on a Pokémon Detail page, the Pokédex will automatically open with that location pre-filled!
For Example, if you click on Charmander, you can then click on the Route 3 card to quickly see the phases.


##### **Stat Minimums Filter**
Filter by base stats - set minimum values:
- **HP** - Hit Points
- **ATK** - Attack power
- **DEF** - Defense
- **SP.ATK** - Special Attack
- **SP.DEF** - Special Defense
- **SPD** - Speed

**How to Use:**
- Type minimum values in any stat field
- Leave blank to ignore that stat
- Example: Set ATK ≥ 100 to see strong physical attackers

**Color Coding of Stats:**
- 🔴 **Red** - Low stat (bad)
- 🟠 **Orange** - Below average
- 🟡 **Yellow** - Average
- 🟢 **Green** - High stat (good)

All These filters work side by side, meaning you can search for specific moves, types, base stats at the same time.

Unobtainable legendaries, such as Kyogre, are hidden as soon as you use a filter, unless the "Legendary" egg group is selected.

##### **Hide Complete Toggle**
When enabled in Synergy Data mode, hides Pokémon your team has already fully collected.

**Use:** Focus on what you still need to catch!

#### 4. **Synergy Data Toggle**
When enabled, shows only Pokémon relevant to your team members and hides unrelated data.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What's the difference between Shiny and Living Dex modes?**
A: Shiny = Shows caught shinies, once a shiny is caught it fills in the remaining evolution line, for example when Charmander is caught, so is Charmeleon and Charizard.. Living Dex = All pokedex IDs must be obtained and in a team members box, for example, catching Squirtle does not complete Wartortle or lastoise.

**Q: Why can't I find a Pokémon?**
A: Check if it's:
1. In the correct region/generation
2. Available in PokeMMO (some Pokémon might be unobtainable)
3. Spelled correctly in search
4. Behind a tier filter set too high
If none of these are the case, please contact Hyper on discord.

### Pokédex Questions

**Q: Can I combine multiple filters?**
A: Yes! All filters work together. Select Type + Location + Rarity all at once for precise results.

**Q: Why does my search result keep resetting?**
A: Pokédex clears search when you apply filters. This is intentional to show full filter results. Just re-search if needed.

**Q: Can I export or print the filtered results?**
A: Not built-in, but you can screenshot or use browser's print function (Ctrl+P).

### Pokémon Detail Questions

**Q: What do the stat colors mean?**
A:
- Red = Low compared to other Pokémon (weak stat)
- Green = High compared to other Pokémon (strong stat)
- Scale goes from 0-255; most are 20-150

**Q: How do I use this location info?**
A: Note the location, level range, and time. Go to that place in-game at that time and search for the Pokémon.

**Q: Can I click on moves to learn more?**
A: Not in this version, but move database included in detail (Power, Accuracy, Category visible).

**Q: What's the difference between ability and hidden ability?**
A: Pokémon normally have one of two abilities. Hidden ability is rarer and often more powerful/useful. Hidden abilities often available through special encounters (Friend Safari, Max. Raid Battles, etc.)

### Location Questions

**Q: Why do some locations show multiple Pokémon?**
A: Routes typically have 5-10 Pokémon that spawn randomly. Location card shows where to find a specific one.

**Q: What does "Horde" mean?**
A: Engage Multiple Pokémon at once. Useful for grinding levels or shiny hunting

**Q: What does "Fishing" mean?**
A: Use fishing rod. Different rods sometimes show different Pokémon (Old Rod, Good Rod, Super Rod).

**Q: I can't find the Pokémon at the location shown.**
A: Check:
1. Correct time of day (if listed)
2. Correct region/version of game

4. Wrong Pokémon form (it might need specific condition to appear)

### Technical Questions

**Q: Does the page work on mobile?**
A: Yes! All features are mobile-responsive. Filters move to dropdown on smaller screens.

**Q: Can I access this page offline?**
A: No, page requires internet to fetch Pokémon data from servers.

**Q: Why is the page slow to load?**
A: First load fetches Pokémon database. Refresh or filter to load faster (data cached).
1. Future loads may be faster due to image caching on first load.

**Q: Is there dark mode?**
A: Page uses dark theme by default. Browser dark mode extensions might also work.
